### Theory
Logic
```
We basically select the north-western most corner available, compute the supply and demand operations and move to the next box accordingly.

1. We take input for the size of the cost matrix.
2. We store n X n randomly generated values in an 2D array.
3. We then elect the north-west or extreme left corner of the matrix, assign as many units as possible to
the cell, within the supply and demand constraints.
4. Either the demand is satisfied or the supply is finished or both. Based on either of these 3 possibilities, we either move 1 column across (if the demand is satisfied) or 1 row downwards(if the supply is finished) or both 1 row down and 1 column across (if supply and demand are equal).
5. This process is repeated until the the demand and
supply are saturated and compute the total cost
associated with the transport.
